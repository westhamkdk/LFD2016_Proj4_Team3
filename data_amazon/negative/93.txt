I can't believe this movie got 4 stars on Amazon, and it's even more unbelieveable that a cast with such comedic talent produced this incredibly dull and unfunny piece of schlock. My boyfriend and I watched it and kept wondering when something funny was going to happen...and nothing ever did. What a waste of $5.99. Sheesh.
