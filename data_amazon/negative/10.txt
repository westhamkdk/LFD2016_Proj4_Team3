Do not watch. I repeat. If you are tempted by the amazing potential of having Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara in an intelligent and funny movie where both can mesh their talents, be warned that that potential is wasted. There might have been one really good line somewhere 3/4 through the movie, but it wasn't worth the unfunny wait to get there. I'd suggest you do not play this title.
