A terrible bore. Beware, the Tarantino fanboys are way overrating this film, because that is what they do. I was shocked at how dull and unoriginal this film was. Where is the creativity? Where is the great dialog? Where is anything resembling a story? There are Tarantino movies I enjoy, "Inglorious Basterds" for one. but when he does something that is not worth watching, I will say so. Dull and pointless.
