.This movie was terrible. It was very raunchy and not even funny. Tina Fey has put out alot of garbage movies lately and this is probably the worst of them all. John Cena was the only redeeming quality of this whole film. Man they tried way to hard to be cool and make this movie funny and it was terrible! Wish I could get my money and my life back from watching this crappy excuse of a film.
