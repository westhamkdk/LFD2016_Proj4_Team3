I read pretty bad reviews of this movie but enjoyed the original movie so much that I needed to find out for myself, and I sure did. While there are many celeberty actors in this movie, it does not help because the plot and the dialogue are beyond terrible. Lines that are corny that were cute in the original movie are not at all funny and there is such a strong grotesque factor to many scenes that its impossible to laugh. There is a new charachter in the movie, Zoolanders son andunfortunately the boy in this role cannot act on top of being an obnoxious character per script. Overall the movie is a badly produced, often disgusting, not funny, very stupid, not enterntaining aweful movie that should have never been made. The fans of the original movie will bedisappointed and for those that did not see the original movie, this one will make even less sense ( which is impossible to imagine),
