It's amazing how an A-list actress like Reese Witherspoon could agree to make such poor film. The writing was poor, the comedy was bland, the plot pathetic and don't get me started on the acting. Given Sofia Vergara is not a trained actress, but she could have done better. Other reviews have mentioned that you have to speak Spanish to get the jokes. Well, I speak it fluently and I barely smirked at a couple of funny scenes. This movie flopped by all accounts. Wish I could get my money back.
