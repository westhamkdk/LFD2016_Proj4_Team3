The fifth wave should be deep sixed. Aliens again invade. After killing off most of humanity at a distance, they have to take care of the survivors. Do they send down troops with advanced weapons? Nope. They separate kids from their parents, kill the parents(the kids never seem to wonder where mom and dad went to), the tell them that the remaining humans out there are really aliens, give them automatic weapons and tell them to go kill them. Really stupid!!!! As all too many movies are these days, this turkey is aimed at kids, so you have to have the routine story of the teen girl who falls in love with the alien who decides to help the humans, etc, etc, etc... Stupid and formulaic, you are better off going outside and taking a walk......
