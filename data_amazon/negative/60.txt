WOW! Horrible, boring movie. Except for the grizzly attack, very unrealistic and no relation to the real Hugh Glass. Watch "Man in the Wilderness" starring Richard Harris...better acting n more realistic. We couldn't even finish watching "The Covenant" with Dicaprio. Don't waste your time or money. If I could give it a 0 I would.
