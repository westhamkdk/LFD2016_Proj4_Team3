It may not be fair to give this such a bad rating because I only made it through the first 15 minutes or so. The story line was predictable. The acting wasn't great. I was folding laundry on a Sunday afternoon with nothing to watch on TV. This movie was free for Prime viewers so I thought I'd give it a go. Nope. I'd rather watch infomercials.
