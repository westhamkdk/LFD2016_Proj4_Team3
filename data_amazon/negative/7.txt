What a waste of two talented women. I mean who wrote this and why would the actors take these roles on? It just looks like they did this move for some quick cash. Poorly written, unbelievable characters, with bad played out stereotypes of men, women, and culture. Sure stereotypes work in films for humor at times, but have some originality, if not that then maybe better execution or some better language. This feels like it was written as a high school production, and put some movie star names on this and let's go make a quick buck. Don't pay for this move--you'll regret it. I just watched it because I had prime, this movie played it so safe it was a yawn fest. It could have been an after school special.
