I hate it when writers set up false expectations and then dash them. And who was the villain? The person they make you like and then least expect. The script writers take very little time to build character and get you to like the main characters – except for one who turns out – surprise – to be the real villain, who is actually a nice guy. Confusing and disappointing. What a waste of good talent.
