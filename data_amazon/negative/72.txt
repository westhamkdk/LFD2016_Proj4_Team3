one of the corniest, poorly acted movies i've wasted my time on in recent memory. the only common factors between each scene are how the actors look. i've always suspected that as a trade off for better roles, A-list actors are required to be in garbage like this in order to fulfill some executive producer's kid's dream of being a filmmaker.
