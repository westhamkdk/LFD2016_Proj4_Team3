As a fan of Tina Fey, I wanted to like this movie. But it was so exceptionally vulgar and graphic that there really wasn't much to like. We inadvertently bought the unrated version, so its possible that the commercial release version wasn't quite as bad. How did all those talented actors end up in such a dreadful film?
