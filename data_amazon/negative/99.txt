This is a low class film, which is a low budget rating of a rating of "C". Don't waste your money. I have no idea where this film was made, but it is not a typical Hollywood film. Poor plot, poor acting, very poor script, a total waste of ideas and your money. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of trash.
