poor effort by the coen bros.i dont know whats happening lately but the coen bros havn't made a funny movie lately.i was looking forward to this movie was VERY dissapionted! the filming and the characters were great but nothing tied it together..didn't laugh once couple of chuckles here and there,total waste of time.
