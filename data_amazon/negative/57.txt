First of all let me say that I love these kinds of movies, and had high hopes of liking this one. BUT this was such a huge disappointment. It was so depressing and miserable pretty much from beginning to end that it could have very well been a Swedish film. And as for the witch......finding her throughout the film was equal to trying to find Waldo in a dark dank forest except way less fun. Two very enthusiastic thumbs down
