Let's see. First of all the entire story is really boring. Really boring. Most of the time it seemed like they forgot what the story was even about and it seemed to be about two girls on a road trip. A really boring road trip with bad humor. Just save your time and skip this. This cop buddy film fell flat on it's face with no real plot, no stakes and everything was just do cringy.
