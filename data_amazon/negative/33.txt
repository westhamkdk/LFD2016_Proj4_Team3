I can't put a price on the 2hrs. of my life I just lost watching this. You are probably thinking, how bad can it be? Its really bad! Watching the previews, you think that Will Ferrell plays more of a prominent role in the movie, but he doesn't even make an appearance until much later on. Who wrote this movie anyway? it has no flow and makes no sense.
