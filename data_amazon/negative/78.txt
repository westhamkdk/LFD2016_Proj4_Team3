Point of view was the problem here. Who am I meant to be rooting for? Who carries the emotional center of the movie? Turns out there's a "gotcha" plot twist that necessitated the fuzzy point of view, but that harms the film as a whole. One great fight scene about halfway through gave a glimpse of what a better movie could have been. I kept trying to rewrite it in my head to make the story better. Oh well.
