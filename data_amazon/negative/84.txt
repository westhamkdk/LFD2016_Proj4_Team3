It was stupid! I wasted 3 hours and 48 minutes of my life that I will NEVER get back! I don't mind blood, guts, gore, or foul language when it adds to the plot, but it actually detracted from the plot which was weak at best. It's too bad that good actors wasted their talent on a script that could have been written by a 6th grade boy with an affinity for violent video games. Oh! And if you think you are going to watch a Western movie, think again! This plot could have been set in outer space and the only thing that would have to be changed are the costumes! And it would still suck!
