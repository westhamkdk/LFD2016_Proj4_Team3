Time I'll never get back. Okay, so the trailer was so, so off I'd almost want to call it false advertising. It claims to be one of the most shocking scary and graphic horrors ever. Okay, after I had to hit rewind about 6 times to re-watch the few minutes I missed from falling asleep I keep asking, "when is this shocking stuff coming?". Here's the worst part...it is an English film (I believe), maybe Irish, because the lighting was horrible and the speech was nearly impossible to understand the accents were so strong.
