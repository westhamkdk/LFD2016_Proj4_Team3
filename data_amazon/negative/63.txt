While I can understand, somewhat, the hoopla about the cinematography (though it didn't seem any more astounding that a lot of movies I've seen), the story is weak and not compelling, the father and son story is unconvincing and Mr. Dicaprio has certainly made better films. The violence is jarring, especially the bear mauling scene, and that might be the movie's most prominent "accomplishment." And WAY TOO LONG at 2 1/2 hours. I'm disappointed that I actually paid extra to see this movie.
