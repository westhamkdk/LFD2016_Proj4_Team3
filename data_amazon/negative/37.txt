For about the first 20-30 minutes of the movie I was thinking to myself hey this isn't that bad of a movie, the reviews were just being harsh...but then the movie just tanked and felt like an entirely different movie. It got so bad that my husband was literally groaning out loud and saying no or this is such crap repeatedly. The kind of movie that is painful to watch so you look away. I'm not exaggerating, it was that bad. One clich√© after an other, cheesy dialogue, ridiculous generic plot, bad acting.
