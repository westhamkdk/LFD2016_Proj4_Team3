This was as cliche and awful as it gets. If you are over the age of 18, you probably won't make it through the whole movie. The story doesn't make any sense, it's unrealistic (even for sci-fi) in that real people don't not make the dumb decisions these characters make. I was excited about this movie. I thought it had potential, but I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.
