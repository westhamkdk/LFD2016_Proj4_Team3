Pedantic and just plain poor movie. Turned it off after 15 minutes. Too predictable and the humor was not there and the story of a well meaning, however too by the book wanna be successful female cop, and an over acted wife of a criminal on the run from bad guys. I like to think it would have gotten better, but just could not take it..
