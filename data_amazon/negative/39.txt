I usually like both the book and the movie. This is the rare case I thought the movie was just ridiculous. They rushed everything, there were major holes in the story that just don't make sense if you didn't read the book. I think Cassie and Ben's (main characters) acting was good. Ringer's was way too forced. I do highly recommend the book though.
