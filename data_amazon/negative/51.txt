Slow, uninteresting, idea had potential. young boy did great job in his acting, the young lady of teen age carried the entire show; was very difficult to understand their English, had a strong British accent-- all the actors did, along with their attempt to speak authentic to its time and place English -- which did seem a strong feature. I do not want to give it away, there was a brief moment, only once which was scary and interesting, but overall I regretted seeing this film. Two goo child actors, the little boy around 8 yo and the teen girl, watch for them in their careers. Not successful at horror, story line was poor. Do not let the cover or previews or music tempt you; the preview music attractive, do yourself a favor, do not watch this.
