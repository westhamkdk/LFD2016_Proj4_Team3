Unfortunately and disappointingly this is not a science fiction movie. At least not the kind you will be expecting from the trailer and publicity hype. You vaguely see one alien ship, no real aliens and no real ending. You keep waiting for the action to start, the counter attack, the way that the aliens will be defeated but none of it ever comes. Overall another disappointing movie where the trailer, publicity and hype are seriously misleading.
