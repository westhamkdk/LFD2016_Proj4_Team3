We took our 12 year old daughter to see this at the theater since we had all enjoyed watching Zoolander as a family often. What a disgrace. We had so much respect for Ben Stiller with Walter Mitty that we just knew he won't let us down with this time. WRONG. Horrible waste of time. Please skip this one and go wash your cat instead, you'll have more fun.
