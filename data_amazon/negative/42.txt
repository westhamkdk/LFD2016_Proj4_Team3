This movie had a few good special effects scenes. The ending was horrible. It felt like a setup for a sequel. Acting not good. Girl gets shown how to use a 1911 (pistol) and all of a sudden knows how to use an automatic assault rifle. Alien turns his back on his kind cause he discovers LOVE IS REAL. If I could add a negative sign on this I would.
