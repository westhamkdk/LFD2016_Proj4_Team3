Given the silly and unbelievable the plot, I found this film to be nearly impossible to watch. Much like 'a river runs through it' I felt obligated to watch until the bitter end just to say I did it. I hate to sound like a snob, but the whole idea behind this movie is just stupid - a bunch of magicians concoct some ridiculous ruse to steal a fortune from some rich guy who basically supports them anyway. And their reason for stealing this money? to give it away. Come on..
