Started off awesome, then turned into a hunger games, twilight, divergent hybrid. Literally there were little kid soldiers.... Movie was set to establish a sequel, I hope to GOD this does not happen and humanity is spared such a terrible fate. Great child movie but terrible for any adult who understands fundamental physics and the basic laws of gravity and human skills.
