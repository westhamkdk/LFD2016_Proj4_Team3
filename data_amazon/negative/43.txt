I haven't read the book, but still wanted to see this movie even with the overwhelmingly negative reviews.I really wish I hadn't. It is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie looked like a low budget Hunger Games basically.The whole movie just seemed rushed and crammed together. I recommend avoiding this one.
