This movie was boring, story was lame. I really like all the actors in this movie, but I cared nothing about the characters. Hardly any laughs, except for the occasional "heh-heh" moment. If you think sniffing cocaine leading to nose bleeds is hilarious, then this movie might be for you, otherwise it's a total waste of time.
