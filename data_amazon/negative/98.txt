Typical pot-smoking crap. I was done with this crap of a movie 25 minutes into it. The scene where Seth Rogen's pregnant wife gives him the vial of cocaine to snort was quite lovely. What a fat loser Rosen is. Is this all Hollywood can come up with these days? Let's go out and get drunk and smoke enough dope to kill a horse? I couldn't stand to watch this movie all the way through, that's how bad it is.
