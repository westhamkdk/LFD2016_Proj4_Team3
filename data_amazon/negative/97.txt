I didn't even finish watching this. The ONLY positive thing I can say about this is that I didn't wasn't $ on it when it was at the theater. I'm still not sure what point there was, if any. It's just 3 guys wandering around and acting stupid for no apparent reason. At least in the Hangover you know that the guys are out looking for their friend. One of the guys seems to be noncommittal (wow, there's a surprise) and now laments the losing his girlfriend after he refused to meet her family, yet the same guy has no problem at all meeting and interacting with his best friend's mother. Seth Rogen is about to become a dad but worries about how he'll be as a father (again, what a totally unique theme). These two run around with their skinny professional athlete friend who achieved success by doing steroids (another shocker). All in all, it just isn't funny. I think it's supposed to a comedy but I finally gave up on it about 3/4 of the way through.
