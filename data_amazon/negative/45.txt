Oh my God this was so slow after the first 15 minutes it was painful. We got near the end and just couldn't go on. It's like it just wouldn't end. Except for the earthquake scene and one interesting twist I don't have anything good to say about it. I would have paid not to watch it. This is one of those movies that everything worth seeing was in the preview - save your money and 2 hours of your life and watch the preview again instead.
