I'm not a Sophia Vergara fan, but I do like Reese Witherspoon so I decided to give this movie a chance. I had to stop it midway through because I just couldn't take Sophia Vergara another minute and I didn't pay to watch this, but just didn't want to waste anymore more of my precious time; life is too short. If you like Sophia Vergara you may enjoy this movie, so make the decision for yourself, but it just wasn't for me.
