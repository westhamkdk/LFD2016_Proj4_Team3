I don't like to give poor reviews but when I think of comedy I think of someone making me laugh. I'm just not into this kind of "silly" comedy. I tried to watch the whole thing but got more anxious to just turn it off so I did. In my opinion it needed a stronger story line with more reality. I liked Jackie Gleason, him and Norton made comedy history along with Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Sandra Bullet, and the actress who plays "Boss" and Whoopi Goldberg etc. who also played silly parts with better scripts and they made you laugh. Their scripts were so much better. There are so many comedy shows/movies/ sitcoms on TV that are just not funny, but seriously just silly.
