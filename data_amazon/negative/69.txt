Certainly not what I expected. Profanity can be expected but sometimes it can just be overdone. In this case, it was overdone, not funny and was';t even inappropriate, seemed heater skelter, poorly written and to be honest, a waste of money The entire time, I kept thinking, why would Tina Fey think it was even well timed or funny? A complete waste of time and money.
