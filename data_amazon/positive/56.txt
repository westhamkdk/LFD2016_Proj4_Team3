Loved this movie in theaters and couldn't wait to watch again. Thought about getting it on bluray but when I saw it available digitally I decided against it so I could watch it again and again immediately. An absolutely hilarious movie! Definitely not for kids. The movie is rated R for a reason and it's a hard R. It's amazing what can be accomplished when a studio gets out of their own way and lets artists be artists. The movie stays true enough to the comic book character while still adding a little something extra. Can't wait for future sequels!
