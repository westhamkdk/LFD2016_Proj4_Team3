Obviously 5 stars because this movie was amazing. It was a return to the fun, old Star Wars of the original trilogy that wasn't present int he prequel trilogy, which was bogged by the science mumbo jumbo of 'midichlorians' and the tech crap where they explained EVERYTHING. The original trilogy didn't explain, the force just was and that was the wonder of it, they went that route again. I'm a Star Wars fan in the respect that I haven't read any of the books and I haven't watched the Clone Wars cartoons. I know what was shown in the films, everything was through the magic of movies.
