Unreal the sheer stupidity of parent's these days, most of them are a mix of Brittney Spears and Steven Seagal, I mean, does anyone even check ratings anymore? .this was a fantastic movie, definitely best casting yet for this genre. Hey parent's who brought their kids and whined like a dog in heat not getting screwed, take a class or better yet, maybe find a tall bridge.
