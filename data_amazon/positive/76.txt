Our family are huge Star Wars fans. My little girls, who are three and five, have been watching SW movies and the cartoons, since they were born. They were so excited to see this new movie, but we didn't feel it was appropriate to take them to see this on the big screen. We felt it would be a bit much, for them. So, we were excited when it was released, so we could watch it with them in a more toned down environment, where we could talk and down play the scary scenes and intense scenes. They loved it!!!! My girls love R2D2 and are now huge fans of little BB8. They also loved Rey, of course. :) She is the new Princess Leia. And, of course, Captain Phasma! Awesome that the SW world lives on, in our home, and continues with the next generation!
