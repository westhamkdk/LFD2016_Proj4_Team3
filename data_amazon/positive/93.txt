t's okay to like Star Wars again! I was a Star Wars fan from 1977 to 1997... and now from 2015 till whenever they mess it up again. There is just enough fan service in this movie to appeal to the old fans without losing new ones that maybe haven't seen the originals. I know, GASP! They exist though, and I know several of them! This successfully brought the entire feel of the original movies back, in what I would consider to be a "soft reboot" where the original characters are still a large part of the story, but are essentially handing the story over to new characters. Instantly likable characters, and amazing special effects... the story could have stood to be less like "A New Hope" but it was needed to bring this series back from the dead, which is what the prequels tried to do... is kill the story... they almost killed it... almost.
