Two young kids in the house meant we never got to see Deadpool in the theaters. We decided to rent this through Amazon Video on our smart TV using some video credits on my account, and it was well worth it! Ryan Reynolds is hilarious, and it's so funny that they pick such a hot guy to cover up for the entire movie, but he delivers a perfect performance for this character. Deadpool is definitely the anti-superhero movie, not suitable for kids, and they aren't making any attempt to make this anything except rated R. It is a brash, foul mouthed, dirty story line with dark jokes, tons of blood and violence, nudity, and overall a good time for the viewer.
