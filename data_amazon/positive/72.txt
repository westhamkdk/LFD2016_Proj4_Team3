This is the best love story ever! Mr. Pool gives up everything to try and overcome his cancer. Sure there may be a lot of violence, blood and death decorating the screen, but sometimes you just have to "let it go" to reach a balanced zen like state that screams you are finally at peace with the cosmic load of crap dumped on you. (as a side note I would like to reiterate what Dead Pool says... This is not a movie for children so don't F it up for us! " )
