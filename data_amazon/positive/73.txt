The kids love this movie...they keep watching it...so I guess I have more than gotten my money's worth. The storyline is pretty funny. The one thing I found a little distracting is that Ryan Reynolds has played so many superhero type characters. Clearly not the movie's fault. This will probably end up being a cult classic and is a fun movie for family nights with a strong combination of comedy, sci-fi, and action. The men of the house particularly loved the stunts! This movie has something that appeals to all audiences.
