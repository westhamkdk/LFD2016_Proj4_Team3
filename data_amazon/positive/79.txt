A lot has been said about this continuation of the Star Wars story. A lot of good reviews and a lot of bad ones. First the bad ones: The biggest complaint seems to be it's close comparison to Episode Four, ANew Hope, saying that they just re-told the story of Luke, Lea and Han switching the characters and mixing the story a little bit. Ok, first, what were all the criticle comments about Episode I, the story was so unattached to the original story of Luke, Lea and Han it seemed like a totally different, until they started to shape the Darth Vader character in the third episode. So now these people get their connection with a new twist. You can't have it both ways critical people, lol. Now the good: The movie IS very much the telling of A New Hope again, with new characters and story, but it works. It's not a cheap rip off, it's a homage to the story with great new characters and a great new story line. I loved it and ant REAL Star Wars fan will love it too. I can't wait for the next movie.
