What's to say? The best Star Wars ever. I've watched all of the Star Wars movies when they first came out, bought them on VHS, then DVD, and finally BD, and J.J. Abrams really put this film together, beyond my expectations with surprises. I've only watched it three times, and each time I see more, plus so many little things drawn from episode Four, the first film. I will be watching it again. Also the special on the disk, explains and shows how they did the tech stuff, including fabrication of a full-sized Millennium Falcon including Harrison Ford's first steps into the full-sized Falcon, and a lot of commentary on included stuff from the original movie.
