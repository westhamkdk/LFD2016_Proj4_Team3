Some corny moments, sure. And I'm sure all the science nerds out there will be able to point out all the inaccuracies. But that's not really the point. Ultimately (for me anyway) this was a thoroughly entertaining, mind-opening experience that made me think about time, space, and our place in it in a completely different way. I so wish there were more movies like this!!
