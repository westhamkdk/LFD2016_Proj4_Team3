I wasn't very familiar with Deadpool as a character so having this movie with the origin plot really explained a lot. I liked the pace of the movie with its constant humor peppered with action scenes and character development. Ryan Reynolds does a nice job portraying the bad ass with a soft side with spot on delivery of deadpan snarky quips and comebacks.I was vaguely aware that Deadpool was tangential to the X-Men, so I thought it was an interesting idea to pull in some of the characters into this movie, opening the door for further collaboration with a larger ensemble cast for the two franchises. Overall, a funny and enjoyable movie.
