This is a fun romp for adults in the super hero genre. Deadpool is definitely in the anti-hero mold. I was not familiar with the character before the movie, but I look forward to his further inclusion in future films. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the wise-cracking, smart-a**. Morena Baccarin is so very perfect for him. They make a "cute" couple, although undoubtedly a bit insane. The breaks through the "fourth wall" are done well. It's a good movie for the mature viewer. Definitely not a kid friendly flick.
