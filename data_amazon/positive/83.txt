I watch it twice at the movie theater. And it was moving fast but I kinda felt like it was long and maybe Ray should not have beat kylo at the end the way she did. It just seems that the next movie Kylo Ren needs to start using force lightning and force drain and abilities that would negate Rey's force strength. As that is the only way I can figure that she could have beat him. Sorry for the spoiler. I felt like Han needlessly sacrificed him self and died too easily. So that was a bummer. But it was not nearly as sad as seeing Leia again. That did not feel like I wanted it to. But hey I guess they are old folks now. And Luke looked creepier than Ben after being out in the desert so lone. Luke looked more like someone you might not want your children having dolls of. He was very scruffy to say the least. And then Snoke left a lot of questions and I don't know why the first order even exist as the empire was defeated episode 6. And the new planet killer was a lot like a new hope. I just kinda wish there was some other jedi that could have helped to train Rey. And Luke's Sister was not strong in the force and did not carry a light saber so maybe her path felt like it was cut in the force or something. I am sure I could nit pick this movie apart. But it is still better than Avatar. And it is better than the smut on TV. That said I guess it was a bit of nostalgia.
