I enjoy watching pretty much all superhero movies from Marvel and DC, but Deadpool is in a league of its own. Guardians of the Galaxy is probably the only other one that really comes close to this one for me. It was very refreshing to see a funny rated R Marvel movie willing to cross a line that I haven't seen from any other Marvel movie. Deadpool is just really fun to watch and Ryan Reynolds is the perfect person to play the character. This movie is not at all for kids so people upset about that should have looked into the movie before going to the theater or buying/renting it through places like Amazon.
