It was truly great to see how a tiny hope and the actions of the few can be to great effect. You carry the fates of us all little one and so he does right into the fires of Mount Doom! This is a great plug for short people. It seems to be a big American culture thing for short people to want to be tall. Well I'm tall and the world wasn't made for someone my size. Sure I can travel faster on foot than a short person but who walks around anymore when they can drive? Speaking of driving why are all economy cars so small? I want to save on gas too! This story is great. It has a lot of depth. The characters are fairly well developed if you have followed the story to this movie and you really get a sense for how difficult the journey really is just to drop a piece of gold in volcano. Okay so the ring is more than just a piece of gold and the volcano is extremely difficult to get to. This was really well played and well done. Great job to all the makers.
