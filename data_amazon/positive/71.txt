This was an amazing movie!!! I finally got to see it, pretty much missed being able to see it in the theater. Watching this made me wish even more that I had seen in on the big screen. Also LOL to all those people who have rated this movie poorly, comparing it to pulp fiction is not a dis! Also of course there was nudity and curse words, its an R rated movie! Do people not know what R rated means? Beyond stupid people being stupid, this was a great anti-superhero movie for adults. It had heart, sarcasm, pop culture references and violence. Really what more could a person want?
