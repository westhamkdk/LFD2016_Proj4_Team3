Certainly one of the most entertaining super-hero movies to come out in this recent renaissance of such films, along with Ant Man. An appreciation for self-referential and self-deprecating humor is a must for the viewer. And, I have to say, even with the skin-altering makeup, Ryan Reynolds is so handsome that the "monstrous" aspect of the character's appearance was waaay less awful than the comic version. But that's a kind of meta-joke itself, if you think about it. An altogether refreshing take on the genre and a must-see for fans.
