I won't review the movie, others have done so ad nauseum and with more literary skill than I possess, so I limit my comments to the BluRay. As far as that goes, I enjoyed the movie fully on my 4k Sony, though I am aware that standard BluRay isn't 4k. The picture was still excellent and better than standard DVD, which is better than broadcast TV/cable (or VCR; but no one uses that format now). Extra features are on a separate disc and I have yet to go through them all. Those I've seen are excellent, look like things I've found on-line for free mostly, but some unique to the BluRay.
