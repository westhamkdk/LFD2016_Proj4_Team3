Went to see it with my wife and 2 year old Friday morning, then again the same with my 8 year old when she was out of school. My wife and I really enjoyed the last two and this one did not disappoint, although I was a bit tired the second time and one can only have so much popcorn. We were in the theater laughing out load. My 2 year old lost interest and took a nap in the last 20 min, but then again she is only 2. My 8 year old love it as much if not more than my wife and I did. It's a great family movie, highly recommend. Will definitely be getting the DVD.
