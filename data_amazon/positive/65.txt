The un-comic comicbook movie. Not for kids. Not for the faint of heart. It is for those wanting an adult experience with proper violence, sex, and adult humor out of their superhero. Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller team up to produce probably the most unique Marvel films this side of Guardians of the Galaxy. Ryan Reynolds plays Deadpool/Wade Wilson, a lighthearted guy with a limitless sense of humor. The supporting case all revel in dishing up dark comedy and it works on many levels. This is a a Fox picture to it takes place in the X-Men universe and has appearances by one well known X-Men (Colossus) and one lesser known one. The pacing and comedy of the movie is great and the villian holds his own. Morena Baccarin is a goddess, fits right in and hopefully will grow with the series. The film is filled with Easter eggs, sight gags, 4th wall breaks, and inside jokes. So many that it's 100% worth the price to own to watch it over and over again. I loved everything about it. It makes me pine for a R rated Wolverine movie to show what Logan can really do with those claws.
