Love this movie it goes with the two previous Trilogy so nicely complement them wonderfully. I was so afraid when they were making this movie that they would totally kill the series and it'd be horribly done and it wouldn't match well. It is perfect it leaves you with so many questions afterwards. We've seen this in the theater and that we bought this the kids loved it can't wait for the next one to come out beautifully done like I am so impressed. It is a long movie I don't know if the other ones are two and a half hours each. But this is fairly long and some of the kids have a hard time sitting through it. But it is great. The first time I saw this my husband said it was more fun watching you watch it then it was actually watch the movie so it's great fun it's Shockers all around. I must see if you love Star Wars.
