There are so many movies whose proceeding episodes do not live up to the memorable experience of the initial film--Star Wars VII is not one of those!! I originally saw this on opening day at a full movie theater where the excitement was palpable. I decided to order a digital copy of The Force Awakens for my IPad which I was taking with me on an out-of-state trip--so glad I did! I happen to have a fear of airplanes, and having this to watch made flights pass quickly, while giving me plenty to laugh at. The animation is stunning, the musical score and acting are top notch, and the characters themselves are endearing, awe inspiring, and complex. More than once I looked up to find several people hypnotized by this movie playing on my IPad, and they couldn't even hear the dialogue. Counting down the days until the release of Star Wars VIII!
