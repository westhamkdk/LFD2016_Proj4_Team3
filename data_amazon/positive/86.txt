I'm old; I saw the original Star Wars in theaters during it's first release when I was a sophomore undergraduate at University. This movie is very well done, and all the improvements in film technology are evident on the screen. The plot is acceptable, but did reflect many of the same points as the first (episode IV) movie, as has been pointed out by many. Still, it's a fresh take with the female protagonist and some updated aliens, so I like it. I plan to see the next one. I don't have any love for the "prequels" I-III, though III wasn't too bad. And episode II was so disappointing, don't you think? Gee, I didn't intend to do a movie review. Oh, well!
