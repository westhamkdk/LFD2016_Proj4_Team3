I love this movie! I laughed harder than I ever have in the movie theatre! It's true to the original comics and Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast! His ad-libbed one liners are what make this movie what it is! That being said, this movie is not for children at all. It is rude, crude and there is hardcore gore and sex! Perfect for a mature adult audience! There are some spots that are hard for some adults to watch, so please do not allow your children to watch this!
