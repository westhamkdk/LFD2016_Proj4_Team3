Streaming quality is very good, sharp clear picture. Extras / featurettes are a welcome addition and adds value to the already reasonable asking price. Deleted scenes were good, but I understand are missing 1-2 scenes offered on the BluRay (which I think is unfair, as physical media is a dying format). Great re-welcoming to a franchise sullied (personal taste) by lackluster prequels. Smartly echoes the original trilogy without completely rehashing them, offers up compelling new ideas, stellar new leads you can easily root for and be invested in, an overall aesthetic that ties nicely to the original trilogy, and a firm stake in the ground to build the last trilogy upon. A worthy entry.
