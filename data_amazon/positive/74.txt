Comedy meets Action Hero!!! And Ryan Reynolds is outstanding! Yes there is some nudity, adult language and humor... even some vilance! Everything that makes Stan Lee Great all rolled up unto probably one of the best action films this woman has watched. (Did I mention Ryan Reynolds shows his bu++¡¡¡♡) From the opening credits (if you miss them, rewind and watch!!!! ) that are hysterical! To nonstop laughs and amazing graphics (Ryan Reynolds ) that will keep you glued!! 5 STARS and 2 thumbs up!
