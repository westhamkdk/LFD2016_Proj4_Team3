I like comic books. I don't mind Deadpool. Not my favorite but not my least favorite either. So I watched the movie. I'll admit it took me a little bit to get into the movie mostly because Ryan Reynolds is sooooooo not my thing. And his weird buff look in this movie.... waaaaay soo not my thing. But I didn't eventually get over that and got into the movie. I can't believe people are letting their small children watch this. It was enough adultish amusement for me to be like cheering it on as not another stereotypical superhero family movie where everyone is squeaky clean. And it had enough funny little inside rubs too to make me chuckle too. All in all if you watch comic book movies i'd suggest seeing this. If this is your first comic book movie... amybe not.
