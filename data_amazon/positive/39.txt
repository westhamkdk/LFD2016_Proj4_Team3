Hope you're ready for several hours of being kept on the edge of your seat! This movie is by far one of my favorites! Action everywhere, graphics beyond its time, a story to keep you glued in, and characters that match their part. The 3rd is definitely the best out of the first three of the Lord of the Rings, although the first 2 should definitely be watched first before starting this one. And the fact that it's extended, makes it worth even more! I would pay up to $40 for this movie
