The movie itself is a a ten star movie in my opinion, however the sound quality which I suspect is not from the movie production itself was not very good. Altogether, the extended edition was like watching a whole new movie.... I can't get enough of this epic adventure that Professor Tolkein has created and which Peter Jackson has brought to life. A heartfelt thank you to the both of them.
