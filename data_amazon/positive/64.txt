Not sure why I didn't like Ryan Reynolds at first, but now I think he is great. Not only is he a very good actor (Safe House, Buried) but he is spot on for this role. Funny how he crashed and burned on Green Lantern (because it sucked, not because he did) and he comes back with a pitch perfect reading of what is, I understand, a beloved Superhero character. Beloved for how completely twisted he is. Reynolds reminds me of Tom Cruise, in some respects. He is so good looking, it is easy to forget that he not only can act, but he can be the epitome of cool. Cruise proves it over and over again, especially as Ethan Hunt and Reynolds nearly re-defines cool as Deadpool. When these super-hero tentpoles click, they click like 1950s Big Studio system ones do (Ten Commandments, etc.) and Deadpool, quite literally, fires on all cylinders. Great backstory, courtesy of the comic-book legacy? Check. Terrific supporting cast, including old-school British Actress Samantha Eggar? Check. Great SFX? Natch. And, finally, courtesy of Reynolds, a lead character that you really care about, despite who completely amoral he is, or seems to be. One of the best superhero movies I have seen in the past few years.
