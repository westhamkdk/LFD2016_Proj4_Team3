Great Movie for kids. My 7 and 5 yrs old love it. To me it was not very entertaining but the movie was not made for adults. It Starts with Po is reunite with his long lost father, he travels to a fantastic panda paradise where he meets a host of wacky characters. It all seems perfect until the evil villain Kai begins traveling all of China defeating the best kung fu masters. Po must learn to overcome his past and band together with his silly, fun-loving panda friends in order to stand against Kai.
