One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I laughed so hard and one of the greatest comic book movie experience that I have ever experience before. Better then the Avengers and The Dark Knight on a very small budget. 52 Million dollar budget to make this movie but blows the doors off of these other movies :) Earns it's R rating.
