If you like the original trilogy, you will LOVE the extended versions! Things that were an afterthought, that are important to the plot, are expanded and explained. The characters have more depth because of the backstories. Many of the plot elements make more sense and take on more meaning because parts that were originally taken out for length are now included with no reduced production quality. The entire film is still flawless. This is a masterpiece.
