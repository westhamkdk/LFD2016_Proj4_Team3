I absolutely adore this movie. It's a throwback to the old movies. It makes up for all the issues everyone had with 1-3. There are some sad things that happen, but I feel they were necessary to push forward the plot. Don't get hung up on it- in life, death happens. It's a fact. I truly feel that this is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every moment of the movie. I was spellbound. It was a wave of nostalgia for this nerd girl!
