I am very happy with the movie I rate it 5 stars and the shipping was wonderful 5 stars on that too, I love how Amazon advertised this film. My only problem, I didn't know until I got the movie and tried it, if you purchase the 4K hd version of this movie, you do receive a regular bluray that will play in your ps4 (don't know PS3, 360, or xb1 for I do not own one) but if you do not own a 4K hd player then the separate 4K hd disc is practically useless, I learned the hard way that it does not play in my ps4, that is my only grief. But I'm still quite pleased with my purchase.
