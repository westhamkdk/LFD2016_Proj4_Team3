I will preface this by saying that I've been lucky enough to see all 7 films in the theatre. I've been a fan for as long as the franchise has been around. Yes you can compare it to episode IV. Yes it will break your heart if you love the old characters. But this is an outstanding movie. It ranks FAR above any of the prequels. I really think Daisy Ridley was a superb choice for this franchise.
